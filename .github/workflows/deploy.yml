# Deploy TapTalk AAC to GitHub Pages
#
# This workflow runs automatically after every push to main.
# It publishes the app to the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages
# can serve from Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → gh-pages / (root).
#
# The app is ALSO live immediately from main / (root) — no workflow needed
# for that. This workflow just keeps gh-pages in sync as a bonus.
