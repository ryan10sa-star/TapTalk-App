# Deploy TapTalk AAC to GitHub Pages
#
# Live preview URL: https://ryan10sa-star.github.io/TapTalk-App/

# One-time repo setup (only needed once):
#   GitHub → Settings → Pages → Build and deployment
#     → Source: "Deploy from a branch"
#     → Branch: gh-pages  /  (root)
#   Then click Save.  The workflow creates/updates the gh-pages branch automatically.
