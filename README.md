## ✅ One step to go live

**Merge this Pull Request.**

That's it. Merging puts all the app files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, images, etc.)
onto the `main` branch. GitHub Pages is already configured to serve from `main / (root)`, so
within about 1 minute of merging the app will be live at:

**https://ryan10sa-star.github.io/TapTalk-App/**

You don't need to change any GitHub settings. You don't need to approve any workflow.

## Why it shows blank / just text right now

`main` currently only has a `README.md` file — all the app code lives on this PR branch.
GitHub Pages is serving from `main`, so it displays the README as plain text.
Merging this PR fixes that instantly.
